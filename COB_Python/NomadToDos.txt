Nomad To-dos:
FeedbackDecode:
	Recompile
	Try big red button to see if Nomad red button works
	
	Stop arrows on stim from moving to electrodes we can't stim 
	proprioceptive algorithm - not just for touch
	Add set value to stim algorithm table
	Combining trainings - select multiple files done? CombineKDFs
	3 array compatibility??
	
	Done:
	Stim waveform amplitude - fix -20 to 20 - DONE


Summit System: 
	NEEDS:
	Buttons:
	Start Training
	Stim STOP Button (Has to be a toggled switch) (stop XipppyServer and turns stim off?)
	Stop Hand Button
	
	Automated backup from Nomad to tablet to internet
	
	(if no prod. XippPy) Get BUTTONS from Elliot's code
		Hand starts with StopHand = 1
		Button would enable movement
	
	General code cleanup
	(nice-to-have) During training, save raw 1k data? Or full time. Should have plenty of HD space
	Optimize DOT Product (to reduce CPU load)
	Python timing in XipppyClientGUI randomly stops working
	Need readme files for each file type saved on summit

Motor:
	NEED to make THE training sequence
		Add some zeros at beginning for hand to get to rest

	(nice-to-have) Temporal alignment of kinematics to emg before training kalman	

Sensory:
	NEED
	Implemented/Needs testing
	12 electrodes (enable/disable via user gui to use 12, implement in stim engine for loop through 12 (raise exception?))
	100 uA/Phase 
	300 Hz
	200 us phase duration
	100 us interphase interval
	Biphasic, Cathodic First
	Max stim per charge delivered per phase is 20 nC (200 us * 100 uA)
	Total Charge per phase 144 nC
	
	Record Spike Times

Troy GUI:
	When you move to stim tab - call "get stim params" to update stim table

################### Executive Decisions ##########################################
NO ability to select previous decode. Retrain or use the last trained decode.

DEKA:
	(if needed) Make CAN comm for PNILabview - mimic what hand is doing.

(if needed) Implement velocity toggle on wrist

######################## Completed (date) #########################################
6/8/21
	Is Mark's stim mapping saving correctly?
		Can we parse it?
	Can we see stim waveforms when stimming?

4/20/21
	Add toggle for updating min/max stim
	Delete stuff in MATLAB R1 after transferring to LabVIEW R1
	Confirm UEA mapping (created new maps)

manual stim (3/29/21)

Test both LUKE Arms (prior to 3/29/21)
	Left hand flawless
	Right hand flawless

EMG on  port D, ability to use 3 USEAs (A-C ports) (prior to 3/29/21)

Try running experimenter GUI remotely.. with another wireless card connected to tablet (prior to 3/19/21)

Make GUI connect to Nomad wifi if not connected (prior to 3/19/21)

Save which DOFs are mirror/lock to file and load on boot (3/5/21)

Initial handshake when GUI connects - send back parameters that need to be updated on GUI (3/5/21)
	LED on GUI that shows when hand is connected??
	Migrate to App Designer - make experimenter and user tab



Saving stim params realtime: frequency, amplitude, electrode, NIPTime (2/9/21)
	Saving to .eyn

Get XipppyServer running as a linux service on boot (1/25)
	Close XipppyServer properly on power down https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/48973/execute-a-command-before-shutdown

Disable bad channels?!?!?! Only from lab/research gui (1/18)

**Some function generation (to-dos in XipppyServer) ~267 (1/12)

**Tying DOFs together (GUI: some dropdown) (1/12)
		Open XipppyClientGUI to see what we set up.
		Basically, each digit has a number corresponding to which digit it should be tied to. Leave as 0 if shouldn't be tied to anything.

Test WTS for all 6 DOF (1/12)

Set up UI for sensory (1/12)

Give user ability to set lower and upper amplitude limits - calibration is done on hand itself (1/12)
	Let user set lower and upper amplitude. Frequency is biofidelic

Lock DOF and set position (1/4/20)
	Velocity mode DOFs always switch to Position

Set nomad time from GUI every time they connect. (12/16)

Need eventparams file (12/16)

Save stim params when received from GUI (12/15?)
	Load on startup (12/15?)
	Send stim params to GUI on button press (12/15?)

Set stim params through GUI (12/15?)
	Probably just have a list of active/inactive channels
	Stim: handling multiple sensors mapped to one channel, and vice versa

Save and reload decode (Kalman Matrices, including channel selection) (12/15)

Find out which aspect of stim_engine is taking the most processing.(12/15) (Deep Copy was the culprit)

Toggle for stopping hand motion while GUI is connected? (12/16) SS['stop_hand'] lines 218-223 or search if SS['stop_hand']

Test .eyn file loading 


#################### Discard pile #################################################
??Send channel selection to GUI when complete

Toggle for stim: user ?must? turn it on every time XipppyServer starts

?? Add user ability to stim on selected channel at selected freq/amplitude for ~2s
	Decision: user presses hand to do so
